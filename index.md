## News

- **[Feb. 2024]** [LLMob](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14744): As a joint work with the University of Tokyo, we developed an LLM agent framework for the generation of personal activity trajectories. 
- **[Jan. 2024]** Our [paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OHINx0XsqTKS-rHOJCTqdY8Cz664Beez/view), which investigates the application of Shannon entropy in assessing students' abstraction levels to optimize students' learning process, has been accepted in the IEEE Transactions on Education (ToE).
- **[Nov. 2023]** [SABM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.06330): We developed a computer simulation framework that incorporates LLMs into agent-based modeling. We released the [slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1GqLjlsjfaN-sbNvLENkAnx8OMlSgeUcz/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=110669723869294635935&rtpof=true&sd=true) and [source codes](https://github.com/Roihn/SABM).
